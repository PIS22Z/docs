## User stories:

* #### Client - who orders from the app:

  The client creates an account on our site, providing personal information and payment methods. After confirming their
  email, they can browse and select from multiple restaurants which deliver to the client's location. After specifying
  the restaurant, they can choose what food they want simply by adding them to the cart. They confirm their order by
  providing all the required info when they complete it. They can use a custom payment method or select the one saved in
  their profile. The client receives a confirmation from the desired restaurant and a summary of the order (what they
  ordered, the approximate delivery time, etc.). From the app, they can follow the status of their order and, later, the
  location of the driver who delivers their food. After receiving the food, they can leave a review to help other people
  find the most suitable restaurant for their liking.

* #### Restaurant owner:

  The owner registers their restaurant on our site, providing all the necessary information.
  They can add and edit the menu, specifying the food they offer, the price and location where they provide their
  services.
  When someone orders from their restaurant, they receive a notification and can accept or reject the order.
  App automatically selects a driver who picks up the order as soon as the employee marks it as ready and delivers it to
  the client.
  After the food is delivered, the owner receives a notification and payment from the client. They can also see orders'
  history and reviews left by the clients and use them to improve their service.

* #### Driver:
  A driver who completed the registration process can open the app and set their status as
  available. Whenever a new order is placed, the app automatically selects the closest and
  the most appropriate driver to complete the delivery process. The driver gets a notification with a delivery summary (
  restaurant and client location, order details, approximated profit, etc.). They can either accept or decline the
  delivery, and if they take it, they can see the full details of the order. After they complete the delivery, they
  receive a summary of the delivery along with their earnings based on the client's tip and price, which they can
  withdraw from the app.
