## PUT OUR APP'S NAME HERE!

### Software functional requirements:

* Clients can browse restaurants along with food offered from their menu and later order to have it delivered to their
  doorstep without needing to provide payment info or address every time.

* Restaurant owners can use the app to present and offer customers various selections of dishes that customers can later
  order. An employee can accept the order through the app when it is ready - and an automatically selected driver is
  waiting to pick up the order and deliver it to the client.

* Drivers registered in the app can use the platform to receive orders needed to be delivered from restaurants to
  clients. Accepting and delivering every order, they receive remuneration based on the route and clients' tips.
